h2. AWS SES fork of: AutoMongoBackup

This fork of AutoMongoBackup uses the "Amazon Simple Email Service Scripts":http://aws.amazon.com/code/8945574369528337 to send backup information emails.
This is a very barebones port of the "AutoMySQLBackup":http://sourceforge.net/projects/automysqlbackup/ project. This bash script will allow you to do daily backups of a Mongo database. It includes periodic rotation so that you can keep historical weekly and monthly backups, as well as daily.
